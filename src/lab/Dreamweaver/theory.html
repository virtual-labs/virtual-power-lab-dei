<p><strong><U>THEORY OF THE EXPERIMENT:</U></strong></p>
<p>Before synchronization, following  conditions must be satisfied: </p>
<p><strong>(1)  EQUALITY OF VOLTAGE: </strong><br>
  The  terminal voltage of both the systems i.e. the incoming alternator and the bus  bar voltage or other alternator must be same </p>
<p> <strong>(2)  SYNCHRONISM OF PHASE :</strong><br>
  The  phase sequence of both the systems must be same. <br>
  <strong>(3)  EQUALITY OF FREQUENCY:</strong><br>
  The  frequency of both the systems must be same. The condition (i) can be checked  with the help of voltmeter and the condition (2) and (3) by any synchronizing  method. There are three synchronizing methods: <br>
  a)  Using incandescent lamp<br>
  b)  Using synchroscope.<br>
  c)  Using Automatic synchronizer. <br>
  <br>
  Now we discuss in detail about  these methods. <br>
  (e)  Using Incandescent lamp<br>
  </p>
<p>Let  machine G2 be synchronized with machine G1 which is already  connected with the bus bar, using three lamps (L1, L2 and  L3) method. These lamps are known as synchronizing lamps connected  as shown in fig. 2.6.1. </p>
<p>If the speed of machine 2 is not brought upto  that of machine 1 then its frequency will also be different, hence there will  be a phase difference between their voltages as shown in figure 2.6.2. Due to difference in  frequencies the resultant voltage 
(<em>e1 +e2</em>) will  under go changes similar to the frequency changes of beats produced when two  sound sources of nearly equal frequencies are sounded together. </p>
<p><center><img src="../Dreamweaver/images/ex131.bmp" ></center></p>
<p>The resultant voltage  is sometime maximum and sometimes minimum. Hence the lamps will flicker,  sometime dark and sometimes bright. Synchronization is done at the middle of  the dark period. This method of synchronizing is known as dark lamp method. <br>
<p>  <center><img src="../Dreamweaver/images/ex132.bmp" ><br></center></p>
  Fig. 2.6.2 Waveforms  when two systems operating at different frequencies.</p>
<p> Lamp  L1 is connected between A1 and A2, L2  between B1 and C2 and L3 between C1  and B2. These three lamps slowly brighten and darken in cyclic  successor in a direction depending upon whether incoming machine 2 is fast or  slow. The synchronizing switch will be closed at the moment when lamp L1  will be completely dark. This transposition of two lamps suggested by Siemens  and Aalske helps to indicate whether the incoming machine 2 is running too slow  or too fast. If lamps were connected symmetrically, they would dark out or glow  up simultaneously (if phase rotation is same.). </p>
<p>It should be noted that  synchronizing by dark lamp method has following drawbacks. </p>
<p>1)    The lamps become dark at  about one third of the rated voltage. Hence, faulty synchronizing may be done  in dark period. </p>
<p>2)    Using lamp method it can  not find out that how much the  machine  is slow or fast. </p>
<p>3)     This method is not  applicable for high voltage alternators, because lamp ratings are normally low.  For such situations we need an extra transformer to step down the voltage.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>SYNCHRONIZING BY  SYNCHROSCOPE:</strong> <br>
  Synchroscope  is a device that shows the correct instant of closing the synchronizing switch  with the help of a pointer which will rotate on the dial. The rotation of  pointer also indicates whether the incoming machine is running too slow or too  fast. If incoming machine is slow then pointer rotates in anticlockwise  direction and if machine is fast then pointer rotates in clockwise direction.</p>
