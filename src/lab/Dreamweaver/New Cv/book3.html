 </p>
 <p align="justify"> Intuitive consciousness/ wisdom is 
 also one of the frontline areas in soft computing, which has to be always cultivated by meditation. This book is 
 an introduction to some new fields in soft computing with its principal components of fuzzy logic, ANN and 
EA and it is hoped that it would be quite useful to study the fundamental concepts on these topics for 
the pursuit of allied research. The approach in this book is to provide an understanding of the soft computing 
field, to work through soft computing using examples, to integrate pseudo - code operational summaries and 
Matlab codes, to present computer
simulation, to include real world applications and to highlight the distinctive work of human consciousness in 
machine. </p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This book begins with the introduction of soft computing and is divided into four parts. 
<ul>
<li>The   first  part  deals  with  the  historical  developments  of  neural science,  background  of ANN  and their applications. Also new generalized neuron (GN) model had been discussed and tested on various bench 
 mark problems. GN  is used for various applications such as machines modeling, electrical load  forecasting 
 system,  aircraft landing  control  system,  load  frequency controller, and power system stabilization problem. 
 </li>
 <li> In  the  second  part, the  book   concentrates  on  the introduction   of fuzzy  logic  concepts   and  its 
 applications  in  modeling  of  electrical  machines  and  load  forecasting  problems.  The  most 
difficult and  crucial  part of  fuzzy  system  development    is the  knowledge    acquisition. System   dynamics 
 technique  (causal relationships)   helps  in  the  knowledge  acquisition  and  representation   of  it.  The  integrated 
approach  of  systems dynamics technique  and  fuzzy  systems has been used for  socio-economic systems like 
 HIV/AIDS population forecasting problem. 
 </li>
<li> The third part lays the foundation for genetic algorithms (GA) and its variant. 
 </li>
 <li> The  last  part  of  this book  covers  the  synergism  between  different  components of  soft computing technology such as GA, fuzzy systems, and ANN. 
 </li>
 </ul> 
 <p align="justify">Dr. Chaturvedi deserves congratulations for bringing out the nice piece of  Research monograph on soft computing techniques and its applications in electrical engineering 2008. XXII, 612 p. 320 illus. (Studies in Computational Intelligence, Vol. 103) Hardcover</p>
