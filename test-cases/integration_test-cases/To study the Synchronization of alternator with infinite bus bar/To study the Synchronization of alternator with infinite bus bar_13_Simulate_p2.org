* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org][To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Simulation of DC Motor link
  4. Enter invalid data in the input fields ( Terminal Voltage variation(V),Variation in Rf(Ω),Variation in Ra(Ω)).
  5. Click on the 'Calculate Motor Speed and Current' button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The result should not be displayed in the output fields (Speed w(rpm),Current Ia(A)) and an error message should be displayed at the input fields as to enter the valid values.

* Review/comments
