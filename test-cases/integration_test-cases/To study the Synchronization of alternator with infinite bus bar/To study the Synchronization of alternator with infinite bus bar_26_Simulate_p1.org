* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org][To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Transient simulation of DC motor link.
  4. Give the value in the plot time field and click on change time axis.
  5. Choose the motor variable(speed,armaturecurrent,field current) from the motor drop down list.
  6. Increase and Decrease the values of ra using the buttos present at the bottom of the graph.
  7. Choose the colour(blue,black,red) from the colour pot drop down list.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Graph.
  4. The time values should be entered in the plot time fields.
  5. When we choose the motor variable (speed,armaturecurrent,field current) from the motor drop down list , the result graph should be displayed on the screen and when we increase and decrease the values of ra the result graph should also be changed according to the ra values.
  6. Colour of the graph should be changed to the  colour selected.
