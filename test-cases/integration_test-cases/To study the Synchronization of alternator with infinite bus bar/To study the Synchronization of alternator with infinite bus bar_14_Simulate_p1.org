* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar/To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org][To study the Synchronization of alternator with infinite bus bar_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Simulation of DC Motor link
  4. Enter the valid data in the input fields ( Terminal Voltage variation(V),Variation in Rf(Ω),Variation in Ra(Ω)).
  5. Click on the 'Calculate Motor Speed and Current' button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The result should be displayed in the output fields (Speed w(rpm),Current Ia(A)).
