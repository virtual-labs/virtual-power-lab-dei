* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To measure the dielectric Strength of transformer oil ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To measure the dielectric Strength of transformer oil/To measure the dielectric Strength of transformer oil_01_Usability_smk.org][To measure the dielectric Strength of transformer oil_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on Checking the Dielectric Strength of Transformer Oil
  4. Increase the voltage  
  5. Click on the restart test button
  6. Now again increase the voltage value

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The voltage to time graph should also vary according to the voltage value

* Review/comments
