* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown/To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown_01_Usability_smk.org][To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on "Checking Breakdown Voltage of Different Electrodes" link.
  4. Select the Electrode Shape as Spherical 
  5. Select the distance between the Electrodes as either 10 mm,20 mm,30 mm,40 mm or 50 mm and increase the voltage value
  6. Click on the restart test button
  7. Now select the Electrode Shape as Pointed and repeat 5 and 6 steps.
  8. Now select the Electrode Shape as Flat and repeat 5 and 6 steps.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. As the voltage valus increases the voltage to time graph should also vary
