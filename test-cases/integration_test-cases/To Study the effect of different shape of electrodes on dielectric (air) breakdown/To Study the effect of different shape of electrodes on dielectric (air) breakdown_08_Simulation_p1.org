* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown/To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown_01_Usability_smk.org][To Study the effect of different shape of electrodes on dielectric (air) breakdown_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on "Checking Breakdown Voltage of Different Electrodes" link.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.

* Review/comments
