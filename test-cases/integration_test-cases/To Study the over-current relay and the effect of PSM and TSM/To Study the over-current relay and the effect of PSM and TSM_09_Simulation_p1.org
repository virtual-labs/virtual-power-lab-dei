* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To Study the over-current relay and the effect of PSM and TSM.  ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To Study the over-current relay and the effect of PSM and TSM/To Study the over-current relay and the effect of PSM and TSM_01_Usability_smk.org][To Study the over-current relay and the effect of PSM and TSM_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on "Simulation of over-current relay " link.
  4. Set the plug setting and set the relay current by using increase and decrease buttons.
  5. Now vary the time setting using increase and decrease buttons.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. As time setting varies , the indicator graph should also vary.

* Review/comments
