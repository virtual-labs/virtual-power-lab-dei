* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To Study the Ferranti Effect of a transmission line/cable ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To Study the Ferranti Effect of a transmission line cable/To Study the Ferranti Effect of a transmission line cable_01_Usability_smk.org][To Study the Ferranti Effect of a transmission line cable_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on "Simulation program" link.
  4. Click on Remove button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The Line Length and Receiving End Voltage values should be decreased
