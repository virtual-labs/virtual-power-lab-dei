* Objective
  - To view the Objectiveof “To determine the sub-transient (xd��), transient (xd�) and steady state reactance (xd) of a synchronous machine ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/ the sub-transient (xd), transient (xd) and steady state reactance (xd) of a synchronous machine/ the sub-transient (xd), transient (xd) and steady state reactance (xd) of a synchronous machine_01_Usability_smk.org][ the sub-transient (xd), transient (xd) and steady state reactance (xd) of a synchronous machine_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Objective link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Objective page

* Expected result
