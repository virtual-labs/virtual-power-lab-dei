* Objective
  - To Simulate the “To Study the gas actuated Buchholz relay for oil filled transformer.  ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-power-lab-dei/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To Study the gas actuated Buchholz relay for oil filled transformer/To Study the gas actuated Buchholz relay for oil filled transformer_01_Usability_smk.org][To Study the gas actuated Buchholz relay for oil filled transformer_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on "Simulation of Buchholz Relay for incipient faults" link.
  4. Click on the pump .
  5. Now open all the values(v1,v2,v3) .
  6. After 5 sec close the valve1.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. when we click on pump oil Level Saturated value should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we open all the valves oil level value should decrease and when it exceeds 100 c.cm the alarm should start blowing.
  6. Again when we close the valve1 , the leakage of oil level should stop.
